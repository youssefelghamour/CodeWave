# CodeWave React App

The **`CodeWave React App`** is the frontend for the CodeWave School Website, built to provide students with an intuitive and dynamic dashboard to track their academic progress. The app allows students to easily manage their courses, view progress, check scores, and stay updated with school news and announcements. It uses **React** for building the user interface, paired with **Redux** for state management to maintain consistency across the application. Routing is handled through **React Router**, and **Redux Thunk** is utilized for managing asynchronous actions like fetching data from the backend API. The frontend also integrates **Aphrodite** for inline styling, **Normalizr** for normalizing API data, and **Immutable.js** for managing immutable data structures. The project is bundled using **Webpack**, ensuring optimized performance. 

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Language for building the user interface.
- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for UI development.
- **Redux**: State management for handling app data.
- **React Router**: For routing within the app.
- **Aphrodite**: Inline styling for dynamic components.
- **Redux Thunk**: Middleware for async actions and API requests.
- **Normalizr**: Data normalization for API responses.
- **Immutable.js**: For managing immutable data structures.
- **Webpack**: Bundler for JavaScript modules.
